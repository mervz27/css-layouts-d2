                <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>Operating systems come in all shapes and sizes. Most of the operating systems in the world are Windows and
                    Linux. Windows is a Microsoft production while Linux is open source with companies like Ubuntu, Red Hat,
                    and others supporting it.
                </p>

                <p>Better to use some text about operating systems in this section here before moving on to
                    application software in the next section. Many web servers run on Ubuntu while office workers often make
                    use of Windows operation systems.
                </p>

                <h2>Application Software</h2>
                <p>Application software is another type of software and it runs on top of the operating system. Microsoft
                    Office is probably the most used application software in the business world. Adobe are the makers of
                    application software for creative types.
                </p>

                <p>Those applications for creativity include things like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator,
                    Dreamweaver, and many others. Still other application software may be software such as customer
                    relationship management software that companies may use to track the day to day business.
